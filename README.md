# Agricultural Entrepreneurship Volition
-----------------------
This dataset is to support the study which explores how urban middle-aged education program participants can increase their agricultural entrepreneurship volition (AEV) during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. 


[the main research questions]  
First, urban middle-aged adults’ formal learning experience (FLE) and informal learning experiences (ILE) , social networking, and outcome expectancy have direct effects on AEV.
Second, urban middle-aged adults’ FLE and ILE have indirect effects on AEV mediated by social networking and outcome expectancy. 
Third, urban middle-aged adults’ time spent in formal learning (TSFL) moderates the relationship between FLE and outcome expectancy and between FLE and AEV.
